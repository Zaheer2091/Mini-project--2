# Mini-project-2 Home Automation
Home Automation System

Overview

The Home Automation System is a smart solution designed to enhance comfort, security, and energy efficiency in residential spaces. By integrating various devices and sensors, the system enables remote control and automation of home appliances, lighting, and security features.

Key Features

Remote Control: Manage appliances and devices from anywhere using a smartphone or computer.

Automation: Schedule and automate routine tasks like turning lights on/off or adjusting the thermostat.

Energy Efficiency: Monitor and optimize energy usage to reduce costs.

Enhanced Security: Incorporates surveillance cameras, motion detectors, and smart locks.

Voice Assistance: Compatible with popular voice assistants like Alexa and Google Assistant.

Components

Hardware

Microcontroller/Hub: Central unit to control all devices (e.g., Raspberry Pi, Arduino, or a proprietary hub).

Sensors: Includes motion sensors, temperature sensors, and door/window sensors.

Smart Devices: Lights, thermostats, locks, cameras, and outlets.

Communication Modules: Wi-Fi, Zigbee, or Bluetooth modules for connectivity.

Software

Control Application: Mobile or web app for user interaction.

Automation Logic: Implements rules and schedules for device operation.
